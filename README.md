# Titanic Logistic Regression 🚢 | Data Science Internship @ Coding Samurai

## 📌 Project 4: Classification - Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset

### 🧠 Description:
This project builds a **Logistic Regression model** to predict survival on the Titanic. The model uses key passenger features such as age, gender, and passenger class. This is part of my practical learning experience during my **Data Science Internship at [Coding Samurai](https://www.codingsamurai.in/)**.

---

### 🎯 Objectives:
- Apply logistic regression for binary classification
- Perform feature selection and data preprocessing
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

---

### 💼 Internship Experience:
This project was completed under my internship with **Coding Samurai**, where I am learning hands-on implementation of machine learning algorithms with real datasets.

---

### 🧰 Skills & Tools:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

---

### ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering (encoding categorical variables)
3. Train-test split
4. Model training (Logistic Regression)
5. Performance evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

---

### 📁 Dataset:
- Titanic dataset (from Kaggle or Seaborn)

---

### 🚀 How to Run:
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
3. Run the cells step by step

---

### 📸 Output Samples:
- Confusion Matrix Heatmap
- Accuracy Score
